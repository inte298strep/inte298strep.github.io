        Strep Eyewear is a not-so-real brand created in 2025 at Concordia University by C. Sok, P. Blanchette, & M. T. Xuan as part of our INTE298 Final Project.
        <br>
        The name 'Strep' was derived from one of our co-founders Perla, who suffered from the bacterial infection during the early days of our team formation.
        Additionally, the Signature Green took inspiration from the rich color of Matcha, a drink that we frequently drank during class breaks.
